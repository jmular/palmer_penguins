This repository includes tutorials and sample questions I made to help others in my lab with learning general R principles and code as it pertains to the ggplot package.

Information the ggplot walkthrough discusses:
  - Setting up your environment by installing and loading packages (both from CRAN and from .csv example
  - Getting a sense of your data by using summary(), glimpse(), colnames()
  - Cleaning and coloring your data to prepare for visualizations
  - Using the count() and table() function
  - P-Value (null and alternative hypothesis) and the chisq.test() to see if something is statistically significant
  - Making plots using geom_jitter(), goem_point(), and geom_smooth(), including seperating using facet_wrap(~)
  - Labeling and Annotating Graphs and other aestetics
